FreeLIP is the large integer package used in the global collaboration to
factor the 129-digit number RSA-129 and thereby solve a 17-year old
challenge in cryptography.

This software was originally written by Arjen K Lenstra
(lenstra@bellcore.com) but is now maintained by Paul Leyland
(pcl@oucs.ox.ac.uk).  Bug reports, ports to novel architectures,
enhancements, suggestions, etc should be directed to pcl.

This package may be copied, redistributed and used for any
NON-COMMERCIAL purpose but the copyright notices must remain intact.
Neither Bellcore, Oxford University nor any of the authors offer any
warranty whatsoever.

The V1.0 release of freeLIP is adapted from the RSA-129 package -- a few
minor bug fixes have been incorporated by Paul Leyland, and some parts
have been modified for compatibility with the latest version of LIP (as
can be obtained from Bellcore). The package consists of this README, the
source code lip.c and lip.h; full PostScript documentation, a
configuration utility liptimer.c and a wish-list of desirable
enhancements called TODO.
